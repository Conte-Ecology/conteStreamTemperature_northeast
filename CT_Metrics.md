 
One application of your modeling that could help us inform this conversation if you could think of ways of projecting this. I have had thoughts of using the summer metric that  we developed with our fish/temp work.
 
e.g June-August Mean
Cold <18.29 C
Cool 18.29-21.70 C
Warm>21.70 C
 
Not quite sure about how to deal with annual variability as it relates to model output. For places where we have multiple years of data, we have seen sites that are stable and are always remain in the same bin, but some flip flop. There may be ways to incorporate some scale or probability of being cool, cold or warm, but I donâ€™t have any ideas on how to do this other than to run for multiple years and report % of time in each bin or something like that. You and your team might have other thoughts on this.

...

I think a proportion of years in each category would be useful for our purposes of showing the tendency of each site to be cool/cold/warm.

Metrics by NHD Plus 1 catchments would work out great for us as we have some experience  accumulating and calculating metrics at this level already.

Look forward to seeing the output.

Enjoy the Holiday,
Chris
